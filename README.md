This is my portfolio website done as a project for the Iron Yard seminar I attended back in the fall of 2014 

It's supposed to display some of the skills I learned during the seminar such as:
>
  1. HTML and CSS3 
  2. Sass as a CSS preprocessor
  3. JQuery as the main JS library to write effects
  4. Responsive Web Design through Media Queries
  5. Web Typography through Adobe Tipekit

But it also include some cool things I learned on my own :)
>
  1. Making Twitter Widgets
  2. Dropshadows on cardlike designs
  3. Social Media Sharing systems
  4. Z-index CSS styling
  5. Writing actual JavaScript as opposed to using JQuery plug-ins

### Yes, I like the color blue A LOT
